## Approach : 

As we need to allocate calculae the minumum number of pages which can allocate to a student with passing all the constraints 
we need to know what is the minimum and maximum number of pages we can assign.
Then from start looping from 
for (I=MinL to MaxL) then check for which value the constrains passes and that will be answer 
to optimize it we can use Binary Search as we know the condition which breaks the side which we want to choose.
